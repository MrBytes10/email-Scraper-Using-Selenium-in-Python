# Email Scraper Using Selenium

This project is a Python script that utilizes the Selenium library to scrape email addresses from a given website. It automates the process of opening a web page, locating all email addresses within the page source, and printing them to the console.

## Features

- Uses the Selenium WebDriver to automate web browser interactions.
- Employs a regular expression to locate and extract email addresses from the page source.
- Handles a specified number of email addresses to scrape.
- Prints the scraped email addresses to the console.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies (Python, Selenium).
2. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and ensure it's in the system's PATH.

- (An easy way is to copy the chromedriver.exe file to the same directory as your python file)

3. Update the script with the desired website URL and the number of email addresses to scrape.
4. Run the script, and the scraped email addresses will be printed to the console.

Please note that web scraping should be done responsibly and in compliance with the website's terms of service and applicable laws.
